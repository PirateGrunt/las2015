## Day One

* _Getting started_ - This will ensure that all attendees have R and RStudio working, can enter basic commands and run scripts. We'll also talk briefly about installing and loading packages.
* _Vectors_ - The vector is the most basic building block of data in R. This will introduce vectors, subscripting, logical indexing and basic summarization. We'll also introduce basic data types (numeric, logical, character, etc.)
* _Data_ - This will build on the Vectors module and move to matrices, lists and data frames.
* _Visualization_ - This will introduce R's basic plotting engine. We'll draw scatterplots and add lines and other annotations. We'll also show how to draw a bar chart, a histogram and a density plot.
* _Basic programming_ - We'll learn control structures like if/then and loops. We'll also write functions and get a (very brief) taste of `lapply`.
* _Loss distributions_ - Learn how the basic functions of statistical distributions in R. Generate random numbers, draw another histogram, perform some basic simulation. Fit a distribution to sample data (using COTOR data set). 
* _Loss reserving 1_ - Introduction to the `ChainLadder` package.
* _Advanced visualization_ - Introduction to the `ggplot2` package.
* _Day one recap_ - Catch your breath, ask questions, have stuff repeated.

## Day two

* _Intro to GLMs_ - We'll demonstrate the `glm` function in R and when one might want to use it. We'll walk through logistic regression and Poisson examples.
* _Loss reserving 2_ - Introduction to the `MRMR` package.
* _Predictive modeling_ - Decision trees?
* _Advanced topics_ - Shiny? Markdown?
* _The R community_ - Where to go for help, ideas and inspiration.
